## 3D Digitisation of Artefacts with Photogrammetry for VR Environments

Explored the application of photogrammetry to create 3D models of real life objects for virtual environments. 
The VR museum is not uploaded part of this repository due to its large file size. Instead, screenshots are presented in this repo.


#### Photogrammetry Softwares
Multiple (free) softwares were tested and compared in terms of ease of use, model quality and render time to identify camera requirements. After reaching out to Agisoft, they provided temporary license keys to use their professional state of the art software, PhotoScan.
Models were then edited with ReMake's mesh editing software and Blender. 
- 123D Catch by Autodesk, now discontinued
- Trnio
- ARC3D, performed with cloud computing
- ReMake by Autodesk 
- PhotoScan by Agisoft


#### Cameras
The quality of photographs taken with different cameras were also tested. This was repeated with different number oh photos for each set.
- iPhone 4 & HDR (5MP)
- iPhone 6 & HDR (12MP)
- Nikon D7100	 (24MP)


#### Object Features & Properties
Models for objects with various textures, materials, size and shape were tested to identify object requirements.
- refletive surfaces
- small and flat objects
- glass material
- repetitive small 3D patters
- gaps/ holes in objects


#### Scanned Objects within the VR Environment
- an old camera
- a plastic skull with details engraved
- fishtank plastic rocks 


#### VR Environment
A VR museum was designed with Unreal Engine 4.
The user can explore the museum, grab displayed models, rotate them in any direction to observe them and obtain a small description of the object. All interactions were coded with the UE4 Blueprint Visual Scripting system. 
6 users explored the museum and were given a basic questionaire focusing on the any differences observed between imported models and real scanned objects within the museum.
